/**
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer,
 * or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
 * There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
 * You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * You may serialize the following tree:
 *
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 *      / \
 *     4   5
 * as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
 * Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree.
 * You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
 *
 * Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states.
 * Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
