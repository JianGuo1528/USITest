/**
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
 * “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants
 * (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *
 * Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
 *
 *         _______6______
 *        /              \
 *     ___2__          ___8__
 *    /      \        /      \
 *    0      _4       7       9
 *          /  \
 *          3   5
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself
 *              according to the LCA definition.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * All of the nodes' values will be unique.
 * p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
