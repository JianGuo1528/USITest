/**
 * Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:
 * 		Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given binary tree
 *           1
 *          / \
 *         2   3
 *        / \
 *       4   5
 * Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].
 * Explanation:
 * 1. Removing the leaves [4, 5, 3] would result in this tree:
 *           1
 *          /
 *         2
 * 2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
 *           1
 * 3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:
 *           []
 * Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].
