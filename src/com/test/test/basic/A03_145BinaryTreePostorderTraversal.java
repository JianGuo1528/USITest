/**
 * 
 * Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: [1,null,2,3]
 *    1
 *     \
 *      2
 *     /
 *    3
 *
 * Output: [3,2,1]
 * Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

 *
 * The key to to iterative postorder traversal is the following:
 *
 * The order of "Postorder" is: left child -> right child -> parent node.
 * Find the relation between the previously visited node and the current node
 * Use a stack to track nodes
 * As we go down the tree to the lft, check the previously visited node.
 * If the current node is the left or right child of the previous node, then keep going down the tree, and add left/right node to stack when applicable.
 * When there is no children for current node, i.e., the current node is a leaf, pop it from the stack.
 * Then the previous node become to be under the current node for next loop.
 * You can using an example to walk through the code.
